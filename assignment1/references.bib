              care workforce is necessary to serve the needs of
              sociodemographically diverse patient populations. Objective: To
              investigate differences in rates of leaving academia between male
              and female physicians. Design, Setting, and Participants: This
              cohort study used Care Compare data from the Centers for Medicare
              \& Medicaid Services for all physicians who billed Medicare from
              teaching hospitals from March 2014 to December 2019, excluding
              physicians who retired during the study period. Data were
              analyzed from November 11, 2021, to May 24, 2022. Exposure:
              Physician gender. Main Outcome and Measures: The primary outcome
              was leaving academia, which was defined as not billing Medicare
              from a teaching hospital for more than 1 year. Multivariable
              logistic regression was conducted adjusting for physician
              characteristics and region of the country. Results: There were
              294 963 physicians analyzed (69.5\% male). The overall attrition
              rate from academia was 34.2\% after 5 years (38.3\% for female
              physicians and 32.4\% for male physicians). Female physicians had
              higher attrition rates than their male counterparts across every
              career stage (time since medical school graduation: <15 years,
              40.5\% vs 34.8\%; 15-29 years, 36.4\% vs 30.3\%; $\geq$30 years,
              38.5\% vs 33.3\%). On adjusted analysis, female physicians were
              more likely to leave academia than were their male counterparts
              (odds ratio, 1.25; 95\% CI, 1.23-1.28). Conclusions and
              Relevance: In this cohort study, female physicians were more
              likely to leave academia than were male physicians at all career
              stages. The findings suggest that diversity, equity, and
              inclusion efforts should address attrition issues in addition to
              recruiting more female physicians into academic medicine.",
